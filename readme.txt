root directory for the restunts reverse engineering project

what goes here?
	
	- tools to for the entire workflow? 
		- tasm, tlink, borland c, ms c, ida (warez?)
	- original stunts, minimal install + decompressed datafiles(?)
	- source for related projects:
		- resfile (old resource parser code by clvn)
		- anders.idc, the ida output generator script
		- hello, "hello world" for dos for testing
		- rehello, asm output from ida+hello+anders.idc
		- restunts, asm output from ida+stunts+anders.idc
	- dos development environment for vmware?
	- docs, notes, etc
